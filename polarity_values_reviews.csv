for recomending such a wonderful and amazing host family to enjoy our stay in 
Australia. We went to Australia with so much of negative ideas and doubts, but 
these two truly amazing people were more than hosts to us.  They were our 
friends and family.  Deanna took it upon herself to help our son to find his way 
to Moorabin airport almost daily to complete his multi enigine flight training.  
In fact we went out for dinner with friends, while Deanna picked up Shehan from 
the station.  We also had a set of documents nicely compiled by her, of things 
to do and places to visit.  In fact they both took us to see houses being 
designed and constructed which is our forte.  Thank you Daryl and Deanna and 
your three wonderful kids and our little adorable four legged Charlee, for a 
truly amazing and an awesome holiday.  We will definitely come back to Australia 
for a complete holiday without flight training and studies next time and spend 
more time with you.  Hope you will have it ready for us once again. 

Cheers and God Bless all of you!

Before we even arrived in Australia, Deanna and Daryl were so helpful in giving us information about where to get hire cars, possible rental homes, things we may need to make our transition easier. We didn't know the couple before this trip, but they felt like long lost friends before our plane even landed. They weren't just giving us a room, they have been like a second family to us. Also, their apartment was so clean and fresh, it has just been totally renovated so felt like we were in a hotel. Deanna and Daryl made us feel so welcome, even down to the little touches like putting cadburys chocolate on our beds for our arrival, and stocking us up with the basics in the fridge to help us start out. Their place is quite far from the city, but that is the only down side (and a minor one at that), but not a problem if you hire a car, which we found better as we got to see more of Melbourne that way, plus we could drive to a nearby park that had wild kangaroos!!!!!!!! You don't get that in the city! So if you want to stop somewhere warm, friendly and inviting then this is the place to choose. You will never feel on your own, and if you ever need to know anything, Deanna will blow your mind with information.

Quick replies and communication. My mother and aunty were kindly greeted into the property. The property was extremely tidy and there was bread, milk and other items in the kitchen awaiting. 

The Bad:
I would suggest that Daryl puts further details in his house rules around acceptance of smokers. I booked this property because it had an outdoor balcony and I know my mum  and aunty would want to pop outside for a smoke.  Unfortunately my mum and aunty felt a little uncomfortable doing this, following some questioning from the hosts. I booked this place to make my families visit as comfortable as possible and I would have chosen somewhere else if I would have known.

The house property is beautiful and extremely well kept. The garden and decking next to apartment is beautiful and amazing to look at each day from the window. We were often asked to use any herbs in the garden and to make it our own. Just outside the front undercover door is more decking, but a BBQ that again we were encouraged  to use. The completely detached apartment is accessed by a gated side entrance and the apartment itself is very insulated. We never heard anything from the house and they never heard anything from us. The apartment itself was amazing and even better then the pictures show. Not only does it have everything you need, it has been designed and constructed in such a way that the space works fantastically and everything is used efficiently. The apartment had a full kitchen with oven, hotplates, microwave, kettle, toaster and fridge. It looks small on the photos, but again, it is so well done in where everything is situated that it feels like a full sized kitchen. The shower is lovely and big with a great shower head. I could of lost alot of time in the shower. Next to that is a washing machine, which we did use and was very happy it was there. Again the bathroom area looks small, but the way the space is used, makes it feel larger. The bedroom overlooking the rest of the apartment is large, but as it is all open, really opens everything up. The cupboard space was huge and great to hide our suitcases in and hang up anything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and big enough for both of us.  The living room area has a lovely large flat screen tv and very comfortable leather chairs. We easily sat here all night watching the tv. There is also a desk and chair that we used as a computer desk with some magazines and tourist information. Along with the desk, there is also a bookcase full of books! Always great to be able to grab and book to borrow while relaxing. The entire apartment is heated/cooled by one spilt system unit, but it does an amazing job. It heated the entire place in only a couple of minutes and we never had to have it on long. Overall, my husband and I were ready to move into this apartment. We felt completely at home and was relaxed in moments. It is bright and fresh and extremely well kept and clean. We were brought clean sheets, towels and tea towels often. There is public transport so close and we even walked to Chadstone. When we are next in Melbourne, this is the 1st place we will look for to stay, as it was very hard to leave.

1.  The location.  We walked from the Skybus terminal at Southern Cross Station (with more luggage you could catch the free shuttle up to the Adina Apartments very near on Queen St)...and kept walking all week!  You step out of the flat into the centre of Melbourne with bars, restaurants, shops and transport at the door or within a block.  No trouble for us to walk to Southbank or even the tennis, MCG, NGV, Botanic Gardens etc.  And there's Hardware Lane around the corner for that nightcap on the way home.  We went on tours to Phillip Island and Great Ocean Rd  and declined local pick up as it was just as easy to stroll down to Federation Square.  The only tram we caught was to St Kilda....and the free circular tram just for fun.  Before I left, I had been mildly anxious about returning home late, if ever alone, to the laneway... but the entrance is only a few metres in from Little Bourke St and there were always lots of people about.  
2.  The vibe.  It really is just like it is in the pictures.  Those fabulous windows and the beautiful light.  And the SPACE.  We had a little soiree with friends and it was a great entertaining space.  We often lingered in the morning enjoying the sunshine... and stayed in a couple of nights, once during a beautiful thunderstorm.  We might have got cabin fever in a hotel room but staying in felt like part of the holiday.  I even cooked a few times. We did not need the air con even on the 35 degree day - the direct sun is gone by lunch time. 
3.  Michelle made me up a bed on a mattress on the floor under the mezzanine that was perfectly comfy for a short stay.  A lot of other places we considered meant that we would have had to share a bed or have one of us on the sofabed in the living room...but this worked well. 
4.  There are a lot of guidebooks and local info in the flat.  This is Michelle's specialist subject/business. 
5.  Michelle was prompt, communicative and flexible with our dates and check in/out times.  

Things to consider;
Think twice if you are a sensitive/light sleeper.  This place is light and in the centre of a busy, vibrant city.  Revellers, garbage trucks and light industry are around you.  We rather liked that ...but I know some who would struggle. The place is designed for a single or a couple -  the shower/hot tub area has no door and leads off the kitchen. The TV is relatively small so your man may have to talk to you or enjoy Melbourne instead!

The location and the place are fun and quirky.  We loved it and had a fabulous time in marvellous Melbourne. ","{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.9983}",0.026,0.178,0.796,0.9983

Michelle was easy to contact despit the fact she was overseas during our stay and immediately responded to any questions we had relating to the apartment.

TV reception is not great but its unlikely anyone would be staying in such a place to be watching local TV anyway so not a big deal.

Despite the fact its location is right in the city its extremely quiet at night so no problem for light sleepers.

If you have a car, parking is a bit of an issue however we chose to drive 15 mts outside of the CBD where you can safely park in local suburbs 24/7 with no parking restrictions (or fees) close to tram and train stops.  We found we only needed to use the car a couple of times and when we did it was an easy tram or train ride out to the car, no hasstle :)

The loft located really central Melbourne, easy to get any transportation you want. The loft is big, nice decoration, and really fit for a small gathering or event. I will definitely book this place again next time if it's a event.

I stayed a full week with my 20 yo son. At several points we had visitors over for a drink or cards and everyone was impressed with the space, all (adults!) took a try or two on the fun swing right in the middle of the room. The space just has a great feel, comfortable enough that we were not overly concerned with ruining anything and nice enough that we felt like we were having a neat city experience.  We felt welcomed by Michelle who was flexible with our check in and out time, and handed over her space kindly and with trust.

My favorite things:
1. Large gothic windows with great light
2. Comfortable couches, and a cozy mattress for the floor, also very comfortable large bed upstairs
3. Great gathering spaces- enough seating for a dinner around table or comfy couches for 6.
4. in the center of everything- right in the middle of the city, easy access to public transport, the Vic market, lots of close eateries, the mall, Chinatown
5. Lots of local books about the city in the loft (the hostess herself is a travel author)
6. Michelle provided great supplies, including shampoo, laundry soap, some spices and instant coffee- all the basics to get us by- and the kitchen was well stocked so we could cook up the things we brought back from the Vic Market
7. Reliable wi-fi internet service, and an hdmi cable so we could watch movies from our laptop

Things you should know to plan a pleasant visit:
1. There's not much privacy. The only door in the place is on the small toilet closet. The shower/bath combo does not have a door and the bath area is visible from several places in the loft.
2. This is not a place for kids. It's a third floor apartment and there are not rails on the stairs within the loft. There are not steps down in to the tub, and the roof access is a bit of a sharp climb- so not a place for anyone with limited mobility.
3. There's really no nearby long-term parking, and it's pricey to park in the city.
4. This is in the city and there are lots of city noises. There's a great clock that chimes on the hour and the half. The alleyway starts ""waking up"" at about 7am, with warm light through the windows and openings of local businesses. The loft shares a stairway with a tattoo shop and you can hear people up and down the stairs through the day and evening.

No complaints from me, I'd stay again, or at any other property managed by this nice hostess. It will be hard to top this experience. Thanks Michelle!","{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.024,0.155,0.821,0.9969

There are some wrong places to stay in Melbourne, but there are also several 'right' ones and this is definitely one of the 'right' ones. Its very central, uber Melbourne laneway grunge, with Collins Street around the corner and China town back up the street.

The place is fabulous and if you are looking at this apartment seriously it is because a certain style attracts you .... and you won't be disappointed, in fact you will probably find that it exceeds what you expect. The facilities and amenities are terrific and if you need something, it's there somewhere. Whilst it's is indulgently large, it would be a very cool place to work out of on business.  Very central to all relevant parts of the city and great home work spaces.

Michelle is terrific, and as she publishes comprehensive (and cool) guides to both restaurants and bars, more useful than you might imagine.

The building and immediate locality clearly have historical significance and are a history-lovers dream. The location was idealistic... side lane off a 'little' street ie not off a 4-6 lane road, not particularly noisy considering it is in the middle of the CBD and close to 'Hardware Lane'. Also its an easy walk to Southern Cross and Flinders Street Stations, to trams, restaurants, cafes, shopping, attractions... 

As no place is perfect we will say, as Michelle has stated in her blurb, the windows don't have curtains, so it is light in the morning, I used an eye mask for sleep-ins. This also meant that on hot Melbourne 30+ degree days, with its north-facing location and full streaming sun, it was very hot in the loft in the daytime. During our week stay my partner was 'working from home' several of those days when it was distinctly uncomfortable. However was stunning and ideal at other times of day (watched a lightning storm from the roof-top), and tourists will generally be out touring during the day.

Travelers that value a place with local character, both in an outside of their rented space, will love this.  It is the antidote to the ""same-as-the-next"" hotel rooms and rentals that are so sterile.  

This home is a lived-in but low-clutter space--a huge, repurposed warehouse with some industrial fixtures (winches, etc.) still in situ.  Where else do you get a 20 foot ceiling in your huge rainforest bath?  Super comfortable place to curl up with a good book or glass of wine gazing at the two faces of the colorfully lit GPO clocktower outside the huge windows.

Alas, you may not spend long in it as it is in the middle of where you want to be--mere moments from ace cafes, restaurants (city's best pasta joint; great ramen, dumplings) and bars.

Honestly, the nicest AirBnB we've ever stayed in, and one of the nicest accommodations I've been to overall. The whole space is bursting with personality, and Michelle is the perfect, considerate host. We enjoyed having a large window-side bath, ambient music played through the (Hidden by Airbnb) Home, ample natural light, spacious kitchen, and really everything about it! Did I mention the swing? Who doesn't love a good swing to start your day? 

The apartment's location is just a few steps away from the free tram, and has easy access to Chinatown and Hardware Lane. We really got to explore a ton of central Melbourne without every worrying about transportation! Even with such a good downtown location, its placement in the alleyway made it feel a bit removed from all the bustle, which was lovely. For us, this was the perfect place to spread out and relax on our vacation. Michelle also offered plenty of recommendations and tips for places to check out, which was highly appreciated. 

The only thing I will mention is, due to its large windows and location smack-dab in the middle of the city, there's a decent amount of noise that comes in. So be aware if you're a particularly light sleeper. This can be from early-morning street-sweepers and deliveries or late-night revelers. The nearby clock tower begins chiming early on, as well. Also, the apartment has a single toilet which you have to go down the loft stairs from the bed and then up some small stairs to get to if you need to use it during the night. These things didn't really bother us personally, but for some it could be important to know!

At last we have internet and I can value our stay at Loretta. I suggest that you go unanounced and check the place yourself. The place was disgusting, dark and smelly this was the first approched.
The pictures in the internet showed in fact 3 times the same room with dif. positions of beds etc...and it didn't show the never been cleaned window (that you could not open anyway) with broken blind. The cupboard were stuffed with some covers, (Website hidden by Airbnb) place to put your things and the bath was so dirty I try to shower as less as possible. It is never cleaned anyway. In fact there was nothing done to welcome paying visitors.(I rent spare rooms in my flat in Germany in Hannover for the fair and I know what I am taking about). The ""help yourself"" breakfast is a joke, lovely Loretta showed us the messy kitchen and the left over of cereal, almost empty jam and 1 egg in the fridge that we could have (when I asked surprised if she would provide something when did bought eggs and jam), I mean what is it about ?? just cashing money...We had to clean every single cup or knife before using it, she never bother at least to clear the table in the lounge or clean a bit around.

Super convenient and quiet location, in the heart of Richmond, within a 5 minute walk to either the bars and restaurants on Swan Street, or the shops on Bridge Road.  
Fully equipped, I had everything I needed for a relaxed and worry free stay.

Frank & Vince were fantastic hosts - I had a issue with my wifi, and they came and fixed it within a couple of hours.  

I'd recommend this apartment to anyone who wants a great location in the heart of Richmond, with easy access to the CBD via train or tram, easy access to the eastern freeway to get out to the suburbs and most importantly within walking distance to the shops, restaurants and cafes of Richmond.

Tips for the local area:
- supermarket on Church St (10 mins walk)
- great coffee and Brunch at Cheerio at the bottom of Lennox Street (5 mins walk)
- Fitzroy gardens are only 10 mins walk away (scenic for a walk, and good for running)
- Catch a gig at the Corner Hotel at the bottom of Lennox st (5 mins walk)
- Europcar car hire garage on Swan St (10 mins walk)
- 3 trams into the CBD within 5 mins walk (70, 75, 48)

The apartment was very comfortable and the photos accurately described the very good quality of the accommodation.  It is just an appropriate size for a couple like us and the flat contained all the amenities required for our 5 day stay.  The flat was furnished to a high quality.  The bathroom is also a very good size although the drain in the sink was a bit slow to remove water which can be improved (but nothing frustrating).  The neighbourhood was very quiet and extremely convenient with trams and taxis available and accessible within walking distance (not to mention the CBD is really close and the stadium of the Australian Tennis Open which was the reason for our visit).

The apartment is lovely and cosy, with plenty of heating (it was cold in Melbourne when I visited).  Everything was very clean and easy to find your way around.    It is also very conveniently located to public transport to the city, and the lovely cafes around Kew.

Perhaps since I had to stay two+ weeks, we had the opportunity to get to know one another and various aspects of our respective lives. However given her welcoming disposition, I feel she would most definitely be like this, no matter how long or short your stay is.

Kate will truly make you feel right at home where you will feel no awkwardness whatsoever. She is incredibly easygoing, and never makes you feel you have to tip-toe around her house. 

She's a wonderful conversationalist when you're both sharing the common areas of the apartment, but she will also give you plenty of space and privacy if need be.

You couldn't ask for a better location to a plethora of amenities close-by: tram stops, post office, cafes, drug stores, supermarkets, mini-marts, bakeries, specialty foods, ethnic eateries, and a myriad of other stores for all of your needs - all within 5 - 10 minutes from her address.

Very clean environment, both inside her apartment (she's got one heck of a comfy bed too!) and her surrounding peaceful neighbourhood. It's an extremely quiet, safe area, with a quaint view of the locale from her room to help lighten up your mornings.

You definitely won't be disappointed if you choose this gracious, hospitable host and wonderful location. Will certainly be returning the next time I'm in the city!","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.211, 'compound': 0.9936}",0.035,0.211,0.754,0.9936

I was told by the listing on Airbnb that ""You will have full use of all other facilities including wireless internet"".  Yet, this is not the case.  On the last few days of my stay, the wifi router was turned off by the host.  This was extremely inconvenient and I had to go to public places like Federation Square for wifi.

What upset me more is the host tried to accuse me of using excessive wifi data to rationalise her selfish act before my check-out.  I had checked my data usage (clearly shown on the router) very carefully every night (as she put high pressure on me for data usage when check-in) and I normally used ~100 mb per night and at most 200 mb.  In contrast, I was surprised to discover that she used up 1 gb a day on one of her sick leave days while I was outside and all my electronic devices were taken out with me.  

It is absolutely her freedom on how much data she used as she is the one who paid for the data.  However, it is clearly unfair to blame me for the quick use of data when she used 1 gb data a day while I just used 100-200 mb data per night and deprive me of the right to use free wifi as clearly stated on her listing!  She claimed that she had to ""protect"" herself and her guests.  Was I not her guest?  Was I not paying enough? 

To be honest, I wouldn't pay AU$45 a night for such a tiny room without wifi.  Wifi was my very primary consideration on booking this room.  If I didn't see ""You will have full use of all other facilities including wireless internet"" on the listing, I wouldn't have booked this room.  I didn't expect my stated right to free wifi was taken away so brutally for such a ridiculous excuse.  I definitely deserve a refund for such an unfair treatment (I won't do anything further for this as I don't want to have any further linkage with the host after this review)!

It is just one block from the beach, and one block from the shopping strip which has a great selection of eating places and Raewyn has a great set of recommendations which we can now agree with!

Raewyn basically deserted the half of her house we could use. The bedroom is huge - comfortable bed, not a speck of dust, heaps of hanging space, a balcony for the refreshing sea breeze with a lounge on it. The ensuite bathroom is also large, good shower, impeccably clean, everything you need.

The kitchen is very well organized, very well appointed and Raewyn has thought of everything you might want - coffee plunger, tea, milk, bread, spreads and cooking implements etc. Raewyn seems to go to great lengths to avoid using her kitchen while you're there but is always available to answer any questions.

The lounge opens out onto a lovely outdoor area with BBQ, water feature and outdoor table setting.

Staying at Little George Street couldn't have been a better introduction to what makes a great bnb - from the well equipped bedroom with flowers on the bedside tables, ipod dock and bathrobes to the great help-yourself breakfast goodies for breakfast (and midnight snacks - I couldn't keep away from the organic rye bread and the walnut and honey loaf!).

Before departing, Ramona gave me clear directions on finding and accessing her home - it was greatly helpful in arriving with ease on a rainy winter's night.  Stepping into her beautifully-designed and well-lit home instantly set me at ease and established a high comfort level that lasted for the duration of my stay.  The bed was very comfortable, and the teas/muffins in the kitchen were delicious!  I loved living like a local in what I consider to be one of Melbourne's most-sophisticated areas.

Ramona herself was very gracious, and absolutely pleasant to be around.  She is very knowledgeable about the area, and gave me recommendations on dining/drinking options which did not disappoint.  In short, she is a fantastic host!

Thus, I was somewhat tired, dirty and weary of moving day to day, place to place. Staying at her place was such a refreshing joy and change of pace from hotels for the following reasons:

First, her location is fantastic. The Fitzroy neighborhood has lovely shops and restaurants and there is very little lodging in the area, so having access to her place gives you access to a neighborhood you could easily spend 2 days in without having to transfer or cab back to the CBD or a hotel.

Second, her upstairs apartment is so separate from the first floor bedrooms, you feel you have the space to yourself. There is a lovely, large shower with window, lots of light, and a side area that serves as a desk and luggage storage zone, keeping the bedroom free from bags if you wish. Although there is a large closet as well.

Third, LAUNDRY! 

Fourth, she left us a chocolate on the bed, a lovely welcome note, maps, let us use the MYKI cards, and basically has everything set up for you to take advantage of the area without doing any legwork on your own. Very welcome after navigating different cities and areas for 27 days.

Fifth, the house is beautifully decorated. There are muffins in the kitchen left for a quick breakfast bite if you need it. There is an outdoor deck to take advantage of the sun, when it comes out.

Finally, Ramona herself is a lovely person. I would 100% stay there again should we find ourselves in Melbourne again.

So spacious (split over 3 floors) and with such unique details, such as the floor to ceiling Antony & the Johnsons mural on the wall, piles of old books, rustic furniture and huge outdoor space (over two balconies!). The room I had was the whole top floor, so bedroom, own bathroom and little mezzanine. The bathroom was spacious and water pressure was good in the shower. The bed was super comfy and the AC was greatly appreciated on the day it was 38 degrees! Even though there were other guests staying in the rooms on the ground floor, I never heard them in the morning in the kitchen area, as the upstairs bedroom is quite separated and peaceful. And finally, Ramona: the perfect host! Cheerful, chatty, and welcoming.  It really felt like I was staying with an old friend. The bread and spreads she leaves out for guests are delicious and the perfect way to start the day.

Parking was an issue, as was the proximity and problematic neighbour who sang at the top of his voice for hours and objected to us playing music on Matt's fantastic Sonos music system in the evening. The walls are paper thin, so if you are not used to living in such close quarters, this may not be right for you. We just opted to not play music and kept all sound to a minimum after receiving a complaint on the first night. Also, for our entire stay, a jackhammer commenced in the morning and continued all day on a worksite nearby. Trucks parked outside the gate and there is little privacy upstairs when the curtains are open due to office workers in the building opposite.

Location & Access:  The location could not be better.  The Milano Apartments is in the middle of the central business district of Melbourne.  It is opposite the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and one block from the Queen Victoria Market.  A big supermarket is right next door.  There are dozens and dozens of cafe, bars and restaurants nearby.  The Bourke Street Mall with the two leading Department Stores in Australia is about four blocks away.  One of the staff members at Milano Apartments was most helpful with shopping information.  

The SkyBus runs from the airport to Southern Cross Station from which a 'hotel transfer service' takes you to your hotel, included.  This is a much smaller bus and people with bigger bags might have an issue.  

Facilities.  Mario's place is on the 18th floor.  What was available to me was a bedroom and a private ensuite bathroom.  The place is very, very clean.  I had a twin bed.  Mario supplies huge bathsheets which are 1.5 m long and thick as a blanket.  He also makes the kitchen and living room available to me.  Internet is available next door at Captain Melville's bar and a McDonald's a block away.  The gym and pool are on the 7th floor.  The gym's set of weight machines is adequate but not great.  

The Host:  Mario is a great host.  He has information and advice if you want it.  Or he will leave you alone.  He is also a good conversationalist.  Mario let me check in at 10 am which was much appreciated, having flown overnight from Hong Kong.

Even though I was in Melbourne, three days before I checked in to his place, I felt like I had already met him. He texted to see how I was doing and if I needed any help. He also so kindly booked tours such as the great ocean road and the Phillips island tour for me :)

My biggest regret is that I didn't get to spend much time with this amazing chap! Even though we grabbed lunch or a quick bite on the last day, will definitely come back to Melbourne and grab a cold one with him.

Wireless internet connectivity was great, went to the spa & gym several times during the week. Bluetooth speakers were fab to listen to a few hip hop beats, and the balcony was lined with fake grass which enhanced the ambiance -- played the flute several times. Mario also left some fridge space which I also appreciated and fully utilised.

Location wise, the apartment is on the more serene, less overcrowded & more safe side of the CBD, edging Carlton, and was close to a tram stop on Swanston that was just outside the free tram zone, or you can go to Elizabeth street stop which is in the free zone. Very handy. I worked at Collins st in the week and it was a nice and close enough walk into the CBD.

Walter and Amanda both were happy to share the kitchen, fridge and dining facilities and  I felt very at home in their family home - I felt like I'd lived there ages after 8 nights of being there!

Great location for Dennis station (a 10 min brisk walk), and not far from Fairfield either (bit further), Dennis being only 13 mins from Flinders Street if you get the right train in the mornings, but the longest is only about 18 mins I think!

I was in Melbourne searching for a place to live and a job, so it was very handy getting to the CBD, and I could change trains in the CBD for other lines if I needed them.  Also the house is just off the 508 (East/West) bus route (Separation Street) which traverses the train/tram lines and takes you across Northcote and Brunswick to Moonee Ponds which is very useful and ran perfectly on time when I was travelling (school holidays).  Walter gave me a lift to Fairfield Boat House - a lovely spot on the river.

Also very relaxed about arrival and departure time - no fixed times were stipulated, which was really appreciated.  Also they gave me lots of advice about different suburbs and local shops and transport options, which was most helpful.  And good wifi connection was very handy too!  And thanks for the loan of the umbrella and the highlighters!

The room is at the back of the house which gives you some privacy/quiet if needed from the main rooms in the house, and also it was nice to sit in the yard of an evening with a drink after a hard day pounding the streets.

All in all, a great stay :-)","{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.2, 'compound': 0.9965}",0.013,0.2,0.787,0.9965

The house was lovely and the room was almost as pictured - the only difference was no TV, which wasn't a problem as we were out most of the time! The room is away from the main house, meaning you have more privacy, and has its own lock. Having cereal, toast etc. provided for breakfast was a lovely touch. We met Walter on our second day there and he was very friendly and accommodating. We didn't get to meet Amanda or their son but did meet Sugar the dog who was lovely :) We checked out the records in the shed but unfortunately didn't get time to play any! 

The house is a 10-15 minute walk from a train station that takes you directly into Melbourne CBD in under 20 minutes. Northcote is a nice suburb - we wandered to the main High street (about a 5-10 minute walk from Walter's house) and there is a wide choice of cafes etc. there, and a K-Mart & supermarket.

We were only there for 3 days but felt very comfortable there and it was a great location for our trips into Melbourne CBD, with trains running regularly and until late at night. Would stay again if/when we return to Melbourne!

Going to downtown Melbourne from the accommodation is straight forward thanks to the nearby tram.

Linda's kindness and hospitality is what made my stay uniquely pleasant. She made me feel at home and was extremely helpful from the day I arrived. Linda provided me with her very kind support even after my departure by helping me with logistics and luggage.

Last but not least, Buff the dog is one of the most well behaved and fun dogs that I hangout with. Its a great fun to have him around.

I cooked my own food there, and the kitchen was very large and beautiful, well laid out and it was easy to find everything I needed. And Linda gave me enough space in her fridge, freezer and cupboard to store all of my food.

The guest bedroom is small, but it has a cosy feeling. And the Queen sized bed is DIVINE, so plush and and comfortable. I wish I'd had time to sleep in every morning! 

The location was incredibly convenient for me as my parents live in Beacon Cove and I was here to visit them.

We were a family of two young boys who were happy to share the second bedroom double bed but if you have preference for two single beds, then this won't suit. The master room has a queen bed and the pillow were the most comfortable I have ever slept on other than my own!!  There is a TV in this room only. Also, lots of Melbourne pamphlets and Julie is a local with lots of knowledge about the region.  She was very kind to stay up late when we were arrived after 11pm.  Yummy healthy breakfast cereals are provided but we bought bread and jams, juices etc and were welcome to use appliances and oven. The bedroom curtains are sheer with venetian blinds so I'd suggest an eye patch if you are photo-sensitive while sleeping. 
Don't pack heavy bags as it is a flight of stairs up to the rooms and bathroom. The shower is strong and two basins plus a separate toilet makes for multiple usage if needed by all in the family. 

Julie has two little white Maltese dogs which are like dolls, do not bark or scratch or lick - just sit around and enjoy a cuddle.

The neighbourhood is quiet even though is part of a 70 unit strata complex.  Parking is only onstreet and Julie gives you a permit.  There are sometimes few spaces available in front but the furtherest distance we had to walk was only one block. 

There are quality Thai, Japanese/Vietnamese restaurants and lots of Tapas bars in Chapel St. The corner hotel 'college lawn' is stylish and excellent meals with many TVs and nice clientelle. 

We didn't try the pool in the complex, but it looked very enticing.

Highly recommended for groups or families with sensible and quiet children.

She explained everything we need to know it (house and sightseeing, programme that might interest in seeing it).    Her home was very clean  , tidy.   Unfortunately, as we stayed during winter, the heater in one of the room was not running so good, also another room has no heater.  I got the allergy of the cold.   Then, no WIFI at her home.

Anyway, we recommend to stay at this house for her kind hospitapility.","{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.704, 'pos': 0.224, 'compound': 0.9425}",0.072,0.224,0.704,0.9425
